# Oryx App - Driver

**Description**:  
The Oryx Driver App allows school bus drivers to manage their routes, update the status of pickups and drop-offs, and interact with the system in real time. The app ensures that drivers have an efficient and user-friendly interface for managing their daily schedules.

**Technologies Used**:
- **Flutter**: Cross-platform mobile app development.
- **Cubit (Bloc)**: State management for tracking and communication.
- **Google Maps API**: For real-time navigation and route management.
- **Google Directions API**: For calculating optimal routes between stops and the school.
- **Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM)**: Push notifications for real-time updates.
- **Laravel Backend**: RESTful APIs for managing driver data and routes.

**Key Features**:
- **Route Management**: Drivers can follow optimized routes to pick up students, with real-time directions.
- **Pickup & Drop-off Status**: The driver can update the system when they reach each stop and when students have boarded the bus.
- **Next Destination and Arrived At Feature**: After each stop, the driver can click "Next Destination" to automatically update the route and notify the next studentâ€™s parent.
- **Smooth Route Animations**: The app features smooth map animations, similar to Uber, allowing the driver to visualize the route in real-time.

**Notification System**:
- The driver receives notifications when a student is ready for pickup and when the parent has been notified.
- The app syncs with the parent and supervisor apps to ensure smooth communication.

**Live Demo**:  
The **Oryx Driver App** is not available on app stores due to security reasons. However, I can provide an **APK** for testing on a secure environment. You can also view the live demo via an Android Studio emulator.
